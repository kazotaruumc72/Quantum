# =======================================
# QUANTUM - Internal Regions Configuration
# =======================================
# This file defines regions for the internal region system
# It works without WorldGuard, allowing towers to function independently
# 
# Format for each region:
# region_name:
#   world: world_name        # The world this region is in
#   min: x,y,z              # Minimum corner coordinates
#   max: x,y,z              # Maximum corner coordinates
#
# You can also define regions directly in towers.yml under each floor
# See below for examples

regions:
  # Example region for tower water floor 1
  # donjon_eau_1:
  #   world: "world"
  #   min: "50,60,150"
  #   max: "150,80,250"
  
  # Example region for tower water floor 2
  # donjon_eau_2:
  #   world: "world"
  #   min: "160,70,160"
  #   max: "260,90,260"
  
  # Add your own regions here
  # Each region must have a unique name and cover a cuboid area
